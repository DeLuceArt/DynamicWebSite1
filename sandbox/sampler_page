        <header>
            <h1>Header are, enclosing an h1 heading</h1>
            <h3>Often an h3 tag would be used for a subheading in this area</h3>
        </header>
        <hr> <!-- This is a horizontal rule and is used here to seperate selections
        -->
        <selection>
            <article>
                <h2>First article, often the left column, enclosing an h2
                heading</h2>
                <p>A p element, or paragraph, often follows a heading such as h1,
                h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6...the six heading sizes from large to small.
                When you're first scripting a Web page in html, it's often
                convienient to use "Lorem Ispum", or greeking, as a text placeholder 
                until you know the real content.<p>
                <p>This second paragraph within the first article will demonstrate
                how to "interrupt" a paragraph with a new line using the br tag.
                It's often used if you want to contain a long text string, such as 
                <br>HACC, Central Pennsylvania's COmmunity COllege<br>on one
                line.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h2>Second article, often the middle column on a desktop PC 
                layout</h2>
                <p>In responsive design, this second article is often used as the
                middle column on a desktop layout; when the sceen is narrower, 
                this article will wrap under the first article on a tablet or
                smartphone layout.</p>
                <p>All three articles are contained with the first "section" of the
                page. The <code>section</code> tag is one of the new semantic tags
                in HTML5; this means they have significance in the logical
                structure of the page..not just for formatting.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h2>Third article, often the right column on a desktop PC layout</h2>
                <p>In responsive design, this third article is often used as the
                right column on a desktop layout; when the sceen is narrower, this 
                article will wrap under the first and second articles on a tablet or
                smartphone layout.</p>
                <p>Two great places to find greeking are <a
                href="http://www.blindtextgenerator.com/lorem-ipsum"
                target="_blank">Blind Text Generator</a> and <a
                href="https://baconispsum.com/" target="_blank">Bacon Ispum - A
                Meatier Lorem Ipsum Generator</a>. In this paragraph's HTML you can 
                see examples of the <code>a</code> (ancor) tag for links, its
                <code>href</code> attribute (hypertext reference), and its
                <code>target</code> attribute to open pairs of code tag, which is used to
                display text in the browser's "monospace" typeface which is usually
                Courier New on a <i>Windows</i>machine.</p>
